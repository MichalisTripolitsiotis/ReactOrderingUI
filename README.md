# Ordering UI with React

My first completed React project, following the tutorial from the following [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Some of the most known hooks can be found in the Repo.

It combines HTTP requests to Firebase in order to retrieve and store data (meals).

Once I will feel familiar with React I will start integrating APIs with Laravel and React as the main FE framework.
